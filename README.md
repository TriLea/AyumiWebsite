### A small website for a small buisness

## 1. Why did I use react?
Huh is he stupid! Does he know hes adding all that javascript for a static site. First of all yes to both.

I used react because initially wanted to use the react spring parallax, due to the vanilla js, css, parallax creation method of using the z axis being unsatisfactory from the weird right shift side effect. 
Second reason was because the client told me she wished to have a multipage application in the future, maybe incorporating a scheduling function, a self checkin system, a payment system like square, a multipage routing system with a nav bar and an gallery for displaying instagram photos that will connect with her instagram via the basic meta api. 
Third reason is I thought it would make for a easier development process when introducing other pages in other languages. I believe it may be a good idea to treat different language pages as components I can all the user to select from. Or maybe this is a problem that I suspect html has already solved and I'm over engineering before I have even begun.

## Anyways thanks for checking out my work
