### A small website for a small buisness

I made a website for a small buisnes, I tried to make it with react initially because I wanted to use so cool libraries such as
react router and react spring parallax. I also wanted to setup multilanguage pages as components that I could return with javascript

I later found out it was not worth the effort, I faced problems with everything from compatibility, hosting, rendering, and basically everything
that could go wrong did. All of this made the project take significantly longer, and lower quality than if I had just thrown in the towel earlier and made it as a plain js app, which is what I ended up going with anyways.
