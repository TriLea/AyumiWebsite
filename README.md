### A small website for a small buisness

## 1. Why did I use react?
Huh is he stupid! Does he know hes adding all that javascript for a static site. First of all yes to both.

I used react because initially wanted to use the react spring parallax, due to the vanilla js, css, parallax creation method of using the z axis being unsatisfactory from the weird right shift side effect. 
Second reason was because the client told me she wished to have a multipage application in the future, maybe incorporating a scheduling function, a self checkin system, a payment system like square, a multipage routing system with a nav bar and an gallery for displaying instagram photos that will connect with her instagram via the basic meta api. 
Third reason is I thought it would make for a easier development process when introducing other pages in other languages. I believe it may be a good idea to treat different language pages as components I can all the user to select from. Or maybe this is a problem that I suspect html has already solved and I'm over engineering before I have even begun.

### Problems

What I found with using react is it took me longer to make things work being that everything was just similar enough to almost work but jsx is just different enough that things wouldn't, and I would have to go learn how to fix them all the time.. for example class vs className. Also I had a lot of photos, and even a video, wich brought the load time down by about a millionth of a second; which is obviously absolutely unacceptable so to remedy this I learned that webp, and webm are optimized file types, and so I swapped everything for those.

### ^ tldr it slowed down developement, it slowed down the site

Was is worth it? I will find out as I continue to work on this site and implement said features mentioned above.

### Anyways thanks for coming to my ted talk, and checking out my work. I look forward to working with you.
