### A small website for a small buisness

I made a website for a small buisnes, I tried to make it with react initially because I wanted to use so cool libraries such as
react router and react spring parallax. I also wanted to setup multilanguage pages as components that I could return with javascript

I later found out it was not worth the effort, I faced problems with everything from compatibility, hosting, rendering, and basically everything
that could go wrong did. All of this made the project take significantly longer, and lower quality than if I had just thrown in the towel earlier and made it as a plain js app, which is what I ended up going with anyways.

# future
add parallax to make better use of limited background
add footer with my details
add multilanguage premade pages (not just using google translate in the browser) but pre made pages for specific customers
try improve seo score, and hope for this page to be listed on google so people can find it
